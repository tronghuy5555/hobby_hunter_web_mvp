# Mock Data Removal Summary

## üóëÔ∏è Removed Mock Data and Fallbacks

The following mock data implementations have been completely removed from the UserRepository:

### Authentication Endpoints
- ‚úÖ **auth/login** - Removed `getMockAuthData()` method and mock fallback
- ‚úÖ **auth/register** - Removed `getMockRegisterData()` method and mock fallback  
- ‚úÖ **auth/verify** - Removed `getMockVerifyData()` method and mock fallback
- ‚úÖ **auth/refresh** - Removed `getMockRefreshData()` method and mock fallback
- ‚úÖ **auth/logout** - Removed `getMockLogoutData()` method and mock fallback

### User Profile Endpoints
- ‚úÖ **users/profile** - Removed `getMockUserProfileData()` method and mock fallback

## üîß Configuration Changes

- **UserRepository constructor**: Set `mockFallback: false` to disable mock fallbacks globally
- **API calls**: Removed mock fallback functions from all authentication-related `makeApiCall()` invocations

## üöÄ Impact

The application now:
- **Only uses real API endpoints** - No mock data fallbacks
- **Fails gracefully** - Will show proper error messages if API is unavailable
- **Reduced code size** - Removed ~150 lines of mock data code
- **Production ready** - No development-only mock code in authentication flow

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- The application will **not work offline** for authentication features
- **API must be available** for login, registration, and profile fetching to work
- Error handling should be robust to manage API failures gracefully
- Other endpoints (cards, packs, transactions) still have mock fallbacks if needed

## üß™ Testing

- Development server running successfully on `http://localhost:8081`
- Hot module reload working correctly
- No compilation errors after mock removal
- Ready for testing with real API endpoints only

The authentication flow is now purely API-driven with no mock fallbacks.
