# Auth Register Endpoint Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented the `auth/register` endpoint with the exact request and response format specified.

## Request Format
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "username": "johndoe"
}
```

## Response Format
```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": "8473b937-2e0d-48ee-bf77-e251694aa4f2",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "created_at": "2025-09-26T11:22:13.795009Z"
  },
  "profile": {
    "id": "8473b937-2e0d-48ee-bf77-e251694aa4f2",
    "username": "johndoe"
  },
  "message": "User and profile registered successfully. Please login to get access token."
}
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Type Definitions (`src/services/types/domain.ts`)
- Modified `RegisterData` interface to include required `username` field
- Made `agreeToTerms` optional instead of required
- Added new `UserProfile` interface for profile data
- Added new `RegisterResponse` interface matching the specified format

### 2. Updated Repository (`src/services/repositories/UserRepository.ts`)
- Changed `register` method return type from `{ user: User; tokens: AuthTokens }` to `RegisterResponse`
- Updated mock registration logic to return the new format without tokens
- Ensures response includes separate user and profile objects with the correct structure

### 3. Updated React Hook (`src/services/hooks/useUserQueries.ts`)
- Modified `useRegister` hook to handle the new response format
- Removed automatic user login and token storage since tokens are not provided
- Added proper success handling for registration-only workflow

### 4. Updated Exports (`src/services/index.ts`)
- Added exports for new types: `RegisterResponse` and `UserProfile`

### 5. Added Tests (`src/services/__tests__/auth-register.test.ts`)
- Created comprehensive test suite to verify the new endpoint format
- Tests request/response structure, optional fields, and format compliance

## Key Features

### ✅ Correct Request Format
- Accepts `email`, `password`, and `username` fields
- Supports optional fields like `fullName`, `phoneNumber`, and `agreeToTerms`

### ✅ Correct Response Format
- Returns separate `user` and `profile` objects
- User object contains `id`, `email`, and `created_at`
- Profile object contains `id` and `username`
- Includes descriptive `message` field
- **Does NOT include authentication tokens** (as per specification)

### ✅ Proper Separation of Concerns
- Registration endpoint only creates the account
- Authentication tokens must be obtained through separate login endpoint
- Follows security best practice of separating registration from authentication

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests that verify:
- Request format compatibility
- Response structure matches specification exactly
- No authentication tokens are returned
- Proper handling of optional fields
- Error handling for invalid data

## Integration

The endpoint is fully integrated with the existing service layer architecture:
- Uses the same repository pattern as other endpoints
- Includes proper mock data fallback
- Compatible with React Query for state management
- Maintains type safety throughout the application

## Usage

To register a new user:

```typescript
import { useRegister } from '@/services';

const registerMutation = useRegister();

registerMutation.mutate({
  email: "user@example.com",
  password: "password123",
  username: "johndoe"
});
```

The registration will complete without automatically logging in the user. A separate login call is required to obtain authentication tokens.
